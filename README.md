## Algorithm Details

### Core Calculation Engine

The heart of SimplePPA is the `calculate_ppa_cost()` function, which simulates hourly energy procurement and cost accumulation over the analysis period.

#### Input Parameters

- **load_df**: Hourly load demand profile (normalized 0-1)
- **ppa_df**: Hourly solar generation profile (normalized 0-1)
- **grid_df**: Hourly grid electricity rates (KRW/kWh)
- **load_capacity_mw**: Peak load capacity in MW
- **ppa_coverage**: PPA sizing as fraction of peak load (e.g., 1.0 = 100%)
- **contract_fee**: Grid demand charge (KRW/kW)
- **ess_capacity**: ESS capacity in kWh (0 = no ESS)

#### Output

Returns five cost components:
1. **total_cost**: Total annual cost
2. **ppa_cost**: Cost from PPA purchases (minus resale revenue if applicable)
3. **grid_cost**: Grid energy cost + demand charges
4. **grid_demand_cost**: Grid demand charges only
5. **ess_cost**: Cost for ESS discharge energy

### Hour-by-Hour Energy Flow

For each hour of the year (8,760 hours), the algorithm processes energy flows in this sequence:

#### Step 1: Scale Normalized Patterns to Actual Capacity

```python
load_mw = load_normalized * load_capacity_mw
ppa_generation_mw = solar_normalized * load_capacity_mw * ppa_coverage
```

Convert to kWh (since each hour represents 1 hour of operation):
```python
load_kwh = load_mw * 1000
ppa_generation_kwh = ppa_generation_mw * 1000
```

**Example**: If `load_capacity_mw = 100` and `ppa_coverage = 1.2`:
- When `load_normalized = 0.8` ‚Üí `load_kwh = 80,000 kWh`
- When `solar_normalized = 0.5` ‚Üí `ppa_generation_kwh = 60,000 kWh`

#### Step 2: PPA Purchase Decision

The PPA contract has two components:

**A. Mandatory Purchase (Minimum Take)**
```python
mandatory_ppa = ppa_generation_kwh * ppa_mintake
```

This amount **must** be purchased regardless of need.

**Example**: If `ppa_mintake = 0.8` (80%) and `ppa_generation_kwh = 60,000`:
- `mandatory_ppa = 48,000 kWh` (must buy)
- `optional_ppa_available = 12,000 kWh` (can buy if desired)

**B. Optional Purchase (if mintake < 100%)**

The buyer can choose to purchase additional PPA energy if it's economically beneficial:

```python
if ppa_price < hour_grid_rate and remaining_load > 0:
    optional_ppa_purchased = min(optional_ppa_available, remaining_load)
```

**Decision Logic**:
- Only buy optional PPA if it's **cheaper than grid** at this hour
- Only buy what's **needed** to meet remaining load
- Don't buy more than what's **available**

**Example**: Continuing from above with `load_kwh = 80,000`:
- After mandatory: `remaining_load = 80,000 - 48,000 = 32,000 kWh`
- If PPA is cheaper: buy up to `min(12,000, 32,000) = 12,000 kWh`
- Total PPA purchased: `48,000 + 12,000 = 60,000 kWh`

**Total PPA Purchase & Cost**:
```python
total_ppa_this_hour = mandatory_ppa + optional_ppa_purchased
ppa_cost += total_ppa_this_hour * ppa_price
```

#### Step 3: Energy Balance Check

Calculate remaining energy after PPA purchase:
```python
remaining_load = load_kwh - total_ppa_this_hour
```

Two scenarios emerge:

##### Scenario A: Excess PPA Energy (remaining_load ‚â§ 0)

We have more PPA energy than needed. Handle the excess:

```python
excess_ppa = abs(remaining_load)
```

**3a. Try to Store in ESS**
```python
if ess_storage < max_ess_capacity:
    ess_charge = min(excess_ppa, max_ess_capacity - ess_storage)
    ess_storage += ess_charge
    excess_ppa -= ess_charge
```

**Note**: ESS charging has no additional cost (already paid for PPA energy)

**3b. Try to Resell Remaining Excess**
```python
if excess_ppa > 0 and ppa_resell:
    resell_revenue = excess_ppa * ppa_price * ppa_resellrate
    ppa_cost -= resell_revenue  # Credit against PPA cost
```

**Example**: If `ppa_resellrate = 0.9` and excess = 10,000 kWh at 170 KRW/kWh:
- Revenue = `10,000 * 170 * 0.9 = 1,530,000 KRW`
- This reduces the net PPA cost

**3c. Waste Any Remaining Excess**

If ESS is full and reselling is disabled, excess energy is wasted (but already paid for in mandatory purchase).

##### Scenario B: Energy Deficit (remaining_load > 0)

Need more energy beyond PPA. Fulfill in order:

**3d. Discharge from ESS**
```python
if ess_storage > 0:
    ess_discharge = min(remaining_load, ess_storage)
    ess_storage -= ess_discharge
    ess_cost += ess_discharge * ppa_price * ess_price
    remaining_load -= ess_discharge
```

**ESS Discharge Cost**: Energy from ESS costs `ppa_price * ess_price`. If `ess_price = 0.5`, ESS energy costs 50% of PPA price.

**Example**: Discharging 5,000 kWh with `ppa_price = 170` and `ess_price = 0.5`:
- Cost = `5,000 * 170 * 0.5 = 425,000 KRW`

**3e. Purchase Remaining from Grid**
```python
if remaining_load > 0:
    grid_energy_cost += remaining_load * hour_grid_rate
    grid_demand_kw = remaining_load
    peak_grid_demand_kw = max(peak_grid_demand_kw, grid_demand_kw)
```

**Grid Demand Tracking**: Track peak grid demand for demand charge calculation.

#### Step 4: Calculate Grid Demand Charge

After processing all hours, apply demand charge based on peak grid usage:

```python
grid_demand_cost = peak_grid_demand_kw * contract_fee
```

**Example**: If peak grid demand was 45,000 kW and `contract_fee = 8,000 KRW/kW`:
- Demand charge = `45,000 * 8,000 = 360,000,000 KRW`

#### Step 5: Calculate Total Costs

```python
grid_total_cost = grid_energy_cost + grid_demand_cost
total_cost = ppa_cost + grid_total_cost + ess_cost
```

### Multi-Scenario Analysis

The tool runs the above calculation for 21 different PPA coverage levels (0%, 10%, 20%, ..., 200%) to create a cost curve.

**PPA Coverage Interpretation**:
- **0%**: No PPA, 100% grid electricity
- **50%**: PPA solar farm capacity is 50% of peak load capacity
- **100%**: PPA capacity equals peak load capacity
- **150%**: PPA capacity is 1.5x peak load capacity
- **200%**: PPA capacity is 2x peak load capacity

Higher coverage means more solar generation but also potentially more excess energy that must be managed.

### Optimization

The algorithm finds the optimal PPA coverage by comparing total annual costs:

```python
optimal_idx = min(range(len(results)), key=lambda i: results[i]['total_cost'])
```

This identifies the PPA coverage percentage that minimizes total electricity costs.

## Key Calculation Example

**Scenario Setup**:
- Load capacity: 100 MW
- PPA coverage: 120% (120 MW solar farm)
- PPA price: 170 KRW/kWh
- Grid rate this hour: 220 KRW/kWh
- Minimum take: 100%
- Resell allowed: No
- ESS: 10,000 kWh capacity, currently empty

**Hour Conditions**:
- Load: 0.7 normalized ‚Üí 70,000 kWh
- Solar: 0.8 normalized ‚Üí 96,000 kWh (120 MW * 0.8 * 1000)

**Calculation Flow**:

1. **Mandatory PPA**: 96,000 kWh * 1.0 = 96,000 kWh
   - Cost: 96,000 * 170 = 16,320,000 KRW

2. **Energy Balance**: 70,000 - 96,000 = -26,000 kWh (excess)

3. **Store in ESS**: 10,000 kWh ‚Üí ESS now at 10,000 kWh

4. **Remaining Excess**: 16,000 kWh (wasted, no resale)

5. **Grid Purchase**: 0 kWh

6. **Total Hour Cost**: 16,320,000 KRW

**Next Hour Conditions**:
- Load: 0.9 normalized ‚Üí 90,000 kWh
- Solar: 0.3 normalized ‚Üí 36,000 kWh
- Grid rate: 250 KRW/kWh
- ESS: 10,000 kWh stored

**Calculation Flow**:

1. **Mandatory PPA**: 36,000 kWh
   - Cost: 36,000 * 170 = 6,120,000 KRW

2. **Energy Balance**: 90,000 - 36,000 = 54,000 kWh (deficit)

3. **Discharge ESS**: 10,000 kWh (empties ESS)
   - Cost: 10,000 * 170 * 0.5 = 850,000 KRW
   - Remaining deficit: 44,000 kWh

4. **Buy from Grid**: 44,000 kWh
   - Cost: 44,000 * 250 = 11,000,000 KRW
   - Track peak demand: 44,000 kW

5. **Total Hour Cost**: 6,120,000 + 850,000 + 11,000,000 = 17,970,000 KRW

### Console Output

`main.py` prints:

- Cost tables for each scenario
- Optimal PPA coverage results
- Peak hour analysis
- Data filtering and export confirmation

## Algorithm Features

### Minimum Take Contracts

Many PPAs require buyers to purchase a minimum percentage of generation:

- **100% minimum take**: Buy all generation, every hour (typical for solar PPAs)
- **80% minimum take**: Must buy 80%, can buy up to 100% if profitable
- **50% minimum take**: More flexibility, buy 50-100% based on economics

Lower minimum take provides flexibility but may result in higher PPA prices.

### Resale Mechanics

If enabled (`ppa_resell = True`):
- Excess PPA energy can be resold to grid
- Resale price is typically discounted: `resell_price = ppa_price * ppa_resellrate`
- Revenue reduces net PPA cost
- Useful when PPA generation exceeds load + ESS capacity

### ESS Economics

ESS provides value by:
1. **Peak Shaving**: Store cheap PPA energy, discharge during expensive grid hours
2. **Excess Management**: Store excess PPA energy instead of wasting it
3. **Demand Charge Reduction**: Lower peak grid demand by using stored energy

ESS cost structure:
- **Capital cost**: Not modeled (assumed externally)
- **Discharge cost**: `ess_price * ppa_price` per kWh (operating cost)

### Grid Demand Charges

Korean electricity tariffs (and many worldwide) include demand charges:
- **Energy charge**: Pay for kWh consumed
- **Demand charge**: Pay for peak kW demand (highest 15-min interval)

SimplePPA tracks peak hourly grid demand and applies contract fees. This incentivizes:
- Using PPA during high-demand hours
- Using ESS to shave peaks
- Maintaining consistent grid draw

## Performance Considerations

### main.py Performance

`main.py` is slower because it:
1. Prints statistics for every iteration (42 print operations)
2. Generates long-format DataFrame with ~184,000 rows
3. Creates comprehensive Excel file with multiple sheets
4. Performs additional peak/off-peak analysis

**Typical runtime**: 30-60 seconds

### gui_app.py Performance

`gui_app.py` is faster because it:
1. No console output during calculation
2. Only stores 21 summary results
3. Optional export (user-initiated)
4. No additional analysis

**Typical runtime**: 5-10 seconds

Both use identical calculation algorithms, so results are numerically equivalent.

## Use Cases

### 1. PPA Contract Evaluation
*Should we sign a PPA for a 150 MW solar farm?*

Run analysis with:
- `load_capacity_mw` = your peak load
- `ppa_price` = offered PPA price
- `ppa_coverage` = proposed solar capacity / peak load

Compare total costs at this coverage vs. grid-only (0% coverage).

### 2. Optimal Sizing
*What size solar farm minimizes our electricity costs?*

The tool automatically finds optimal coverage by comparing all scenarios. Check the "Optimal PPA coverage" result.

### 3. ESS Investment Analysis
*Should we add battery storage?*

Run twice:
- Once with `ess_include = False`
- Once with `ess_include = True` and desired capacity

Compare optimal costs. The difference is the maximum ESS investment that makes economic sense (before considering ESS capital costs).

### 4. Contract Terms Negotiation
*How much is resale worth? What about minimum take?*

Adjust `ppa_resell`, `ppa_resellrate`, and `ppa_mintake` to see impact on total costs. This helps evaluate different contract structures.

### 5. Seasonal Analysis
*How does PPA perform in summer vs. winter?*

Use the long-format Excel output to create pivot tables grouped by month or season.

## Limitations

1. **Hourly Resolution**: Uses hourly averages, not 15-minute intervals (actual demand charge basis)
2. **Perfect Forecast**: Assumes perfect knowledge of future generation and load
3. **No Uncertainty**: Deterministic model, no weather variability or forecast errors
4. **No Degradation**: Solar and ESS performance assumed constant over time
5. **No ESS Capital Cost**: Only operational costs modeled
6. **Single Grid Tariff**: Uses one tariff type, real contracts may have options
7. **No Transmission Losses**: Assumes perfect energy delivery
8. **No Grid Limitations**: Assumes unlimited grid capacity

## Advanced Customization

### Custom Load Patterns

Edit `data/pattern.xlsx`:
- Column 'load': Normalized hourly load (0-1, where 1 = peak)
- Column 'solar': Normalized hourly solar generation (0-1, where 1 = peak)
- Must have 8,760 rows (one year, hourly)

### Custom Grid Rates

Edit `data/KEPCO.xlsx` or modify `libs/KEPCOutils.py` to load your utility's tariff structure.

### Different Time Periods

In `main.py`, adjust:
```python
start_date = '2024-01-01'
end_date = '2024-12-31'
```

Can analyze shorter periods (e.g., summer only) or specific years.

### ESS Capacity Strategies

Choose ESS sizing:
- **Hours-based**: `ess_capacity = hours * peak_solar_mw * 1000`
- **Percentage-based**: `ess_capacity = pct * peak_solar_mw * 1000`
- **Absolute**: `ess_capacity = 50000  # 50 MWh`
